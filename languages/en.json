To be readied, a power must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the power's magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the power dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the&nbsp;web&nbsp;power and ready&nbsp;magic missile, your&nbsp;web&nbsp;power ends, and if you take damage before you release&nbsp;magic missile&nbsp;with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.</p>",
